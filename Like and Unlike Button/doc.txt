A simple interactive webpage that features a "like" button functionality, primarily implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the aid of Bootstrap for styling and Font Awesome for icons. The code is structured to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface that allows users to "like" an image of a puppy, which in turn alters the visual state of the webpage.

HTML Structure
The HTML code starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which defines the document as an HTML5 document. The <html> tag encloses the entire content of the webpage, followed by the <head> section, which includes meta-information, such as links to external stylesheets and scripts. The webpage imports Bootstrap from a CDN for responsive design and pre-built components, along with jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript for interactive features. Additionally, Font Awesome is included to provide access to a variety of icons, specifically the "thumbs-up" icon used in this case.

Within the <body> tag, the structure includes an image element (<img>) and a button, both of which are the key elements of the interactive feature. The image is sourced from a URL and is assigned the class puppy-image and an ID puppyImage. The class ensures that the image's width is set to 100%, making it responsive.

The div element that follows contains the interactive elements, which are aligned centrally on the webpage using Bootstrap's d-flex, flex-row, and justify-content-center classes. The fa-thumbs-up icon, provided by Font Awesome, is used as a visual indicator of the "like" action and is followed by a button element labeled "Like". Both the icon and the button have their unique IDs (likeIcon and likeButton respectively), which are referenced in the JavaScript to manage their behavior.

CSS Styling
The embedded CSS, found in the <style> block or external stylesheet, dictates the appearance of the image and interactive elements. The puppy-image class ensures that the image scales appropriately within its container by setting its width to 100%. The like-icon class sets the initial color of the icon to a muted shade (#cbd2d9) and defines its size as 40px to ensure it is easily visible.

The like-button class styles the button with a muted background color (#cbd2d9), text color (#9aa5b1), and additional attributes like font size, button dimensions, and rounded corners, creating a consistent and modern appearance in line with typical Bootstrap buttons.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code introduces interactivity to the webpage. It begins by selecting the relevant DOM elements (likeButtonElement, likeIconElement, and puppyImage) using getElementById. A boolean variable, isLiked, is initialized to false to track the state of the "like" feature.

The onClickLikeButton function is the core of the interactivity. When the button is clicked, the function checks the current state of isLiked. If isLiked is false, indicating that the image has not been liked, the function changes the image source to a different image (a "liked" puppy image) and updates the icon and button colors to a highlighted shade (#0967d2). The isLiked variable is then set to true. If the image is already liked (isLiked is true), the function reverts the image, icon, and button colors to their original states and sets isLiked back to false.

Conclusion
Overall, this code effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive webpage. The use of external libraries like Bootstrap and Font Awesome simplifies styling and iconography, while the JavaScript function adds dynamic behavior, making the webpage both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
