The application utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the interactivity. Additionally, the Bootstrap framework is integrated for basic layout and responsiveness.

HTML Structure
The HTML file begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, ensuring that the document is recognized as HTML5. The <head> section includes links to external resources, specifically Bootstrap and jQuery libraries. Bootstrap is used for styling and layout management, while jQuery facilitates easy DOM manipulation and event handling.

Inside the <body> tag, custom CSS is defined to style specific elements of the application. The CSS styles define the background color, text alignment, font properties, and button styles. The primary container of the application, represented by the div element with the class bg-container, is centrally aligned using Bootstrap's flexbox utilities (d-flex, flex-column, justify-content-center, text-center), ensuring that the content is vertically and horizontally centered within the viewport.

The application features a heading (Counter), a paragraph element (<p>) to display the counter value, and three buttons (DECREASE, RESET, INCREASE). These buttons trigger the corresponding JavaScript functions (onDecrement, onReset, onIncrement) when clicked.

JavaScript Interactivity
The interactivity of the counter application is handled through JavaScript, which is linked in the HTML via an external script file, Counter-application.js. This script contains three primary functions that control the behavior of the counter:

onIncrement(): This function is executed when the "INCREASE" button is clicked. It retrieves the current counter value from the counterValue element, converts it to an integer, increments it by one, and updates the displayed value. Additionally, the text color of the counter changes based on the value: green for positive numbers, red for negative, and black for zero. This visual feedback enhances user experience by immediately conveying whether the counter is positive, negative, or neutral.

onDecrement(): Triggered by the "DECREASE" button, this function behaves similarly to onIncrement(), but it decreases the counter value by one. The color of the counter is also updated according to the value.

onReset(): When the "RESET" button is clicked, this function resets the counter value to zero and changes the text color back to black, indicating a neutral state.

User Experience and Functionality
This counter application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The minimalist design, coupled with color-coded feedback, makes it easy for users to understand the current state of the counter. The buttons are clearly labeled, and their functionality is straightforward, ensuring that users can interact with the counter without any confusion.

The use of Bootstrap ensures that the application is responsive, meaning it will display correctly on various devices and screen sizes. The CSS customizations align with the overall design, providing a consistent look and feel.

In conclusion, this counter application serves as a fundamental example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create interactive web applications. It effectively demonstrates the power of JavaScript in manipulating the DOM and providing real-time feedback to users, all within a clean and responsive interface facilitated by Bootstrap.
