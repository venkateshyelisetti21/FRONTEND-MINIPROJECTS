HTML Structure
The HTML document begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which defines the document type and version. The html tag encapsulates the entire document, which includes two main sections: the head and the body.

Head Section
The head section contains links to external resources:

Bootstrap CSS: A link to the Bootstrap framework’s CSS file is provided via a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that offers pre-designed components and styles to ensure a responsive and consistent design across devices.

jQuery and Bootstrap JS: The section includes jQuery and Bootstrap's JavaScript files, which are also loaded via CDN. These scripts provide functionality for dynamic behavior and interactivity. jQuery is a widely used JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions. Bootstrap’s JavaScript components require jQuery to function.

Body Section
The body of the document contains a style block with custom CSS and the main content wrapped within the container div.

Custom CSS
.bg: A class defining a white background and full viewport height (100vh) for the main content section.
.heading: Sets the font family to "Roboto" for the heading element.
.button1, .button2, .button3, .button4: These classes define the style for the four buttons, including padding, border-radius, background colors, and text colors. Each button has a different background color corresponding to the color it will apply when clicked.
.color-para-bg: Defines the background color as black with white text, rounded corners, and bold, medium-sized text for the paragraph that displays the selected background color.
.span-color: A class that sets the text color to a light blue shade.
Main Content
The content is wrapped inside a container div that uses Bootstrap's grid system. The layout centers the main content horizontally on the page using two col classes, with the central column occupying six out of twelve grid spaces (col-lg-6).

Heading: A centered heading with the text "Color Picker" styled by the .heading class.
Buttons: Four buttons are displayed below the heading. Each button has an onclick event that triggers a corresponding JavaScript function to change the background color.
Paragraph: Below the buttons, a paragraph displays the current background color. The paragraph uses the .color-para-bg class for styling, and the color code is displayed inside a span element with the id of "spanName".
JavaScript
The script is linked externally and contains four functions—buttn1(), buttn2(), buttn3(), and buttn4()—each corresponding to a button.

Event Handling: When a button is clicked, its respective function is triggered.
DOM Manipulation: The background color of the div with the id "background" is changed, and the color code is updated in the span element with the id "spanName".
Each function updates the backgroundColor of the bg element and the textContent of the spanName element to match the selected color.

Conclusion
This code provides a clean and straightforward user interface where users can interactively change the background color of a webpage section by clicking on buttons. The use of Bootstrap ensures that the design is responsive, while custom CSS and JavaScript enable the interactive functionality.
